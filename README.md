# The Best Mods for Performance. Quality-Of-Life features too!
These are the most up-to-date mods that I personally use. This modpack is capable of tripling your performance, revamping menus, and giving you a smoother experience without changing the vanilla gameplay. Keep in mind that these mods are currently for 1.20.1.

## Keep In Mind
- Some of these mods are configurable, and if you wish to configure them, you have to install Mod Menu and Cloth Config API.
- If you're using Sodium and you get a crash (or another weird bug) that is caused by another mod, install Indium and that will hopefully fix it (ex. Continuity uses the Fabric Rendering API, so it requires Indium to work with Sodium)
- If you get a lot of Errors Make sure to Install Fabric API. Since almost all mods require the Fabric API to function properly,
- You must install Fabric to run these mods. Don't know how? Watch this [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L0KKSfeG1g)!
